> *Dear Mr. Carraway.*

I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.*
>

> and then hasty addenda beneath:
>> *Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.*
